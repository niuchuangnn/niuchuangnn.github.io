<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p style="text-align:justify;">
Denoising is a prerequisite for image analysis tasks in many fields.
Supervised deep denoising methods are popular but they require paired clean or noisy samples that are often unavailable in practice.
Here we propose the first similarity-based unsupervised deep denoising approach, referred to as Noise2Sim, that works in a nonlocal
and nonlinear fashion to suppress not only independent but also correlated noises.
Theoretically, Noise2Sim is equivalent to supervised denoising under mild conditions.
Experimental results on common benchmarks and practical datasets show that
Nosie2Sim recovers intrinsic structures from noisy low-dose and photon-counting CT images, and is competitive to or even better than
the supervised learning methods.
