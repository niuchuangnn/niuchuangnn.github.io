Hi :wave:

I am a Research Scientist at <a href="https://www.rpi.edu/"> Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute </a> and serve as an Associate Director in <a href="https://wang-axis.github.io/">AXIS Lab</a> 
led by Prof. <a href="https://faculty.rpi.edu/ge-wang"> Ge Wang</a>.I received my B.S. in biomedical engineering in 2015, 
and my Ph.D. in pattern recognition and machine intelligence in 2020,
from <a href="https://en.xidian.edu.cn/">Xidian University </a>.
I was a visiting student from 2019 to 2020 and a Postdoc from 2020 to 2023 at <a href="https://www.rpi.edu/"> Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute </a>.

My research interest is in Medical Multimodal Multitask Foundation Model (M3FM), self-supervised/unsupervised learning, weakly-supervised learning,
representation learning, clustering, and biomedical imaging and analysis.

I have been working on weakly-supervised especially self-supervised learning algorithm development since 2018,
with the applications in image segmentation, image classification/clustering, representation learning for object recognition and detection, medical CT imaging, and large foundation models for medical multimodal AI.

I firmly believe that AI is transforming and will continue to revolutionize healthcare by reducing costs, improving efficiency, enhancing quality, and addressing unmet needs for a better quality of life.
