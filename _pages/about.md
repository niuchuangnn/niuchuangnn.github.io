Hi :wave:

I am a Postdoc and serve as an Associate Director in <a href="https://wang-axis.github.io/">AXIS Lab</a> 
led by Prof. <a href="https://faculty.rpi.edu/ge-wang"> Ge Wang</a> 
at <a href="https://www.rpi.edu/"> Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute </a>.
I received my B.S. in biomedical engineering in 2015, 
and my Ph.D. in pattern recognition and machine intelligence in 2020,
from <a href="https://en.xidian.edu.cn/">Xidian University </a>.
I was a visiting student 
at <a href="https://www.rpi.edu/"> Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute </a> from 2019 to 2020.

My research interest is in unsupervised/self-supervised learning, weakly-supervised learning,
representation learning, clustering, and biomedical imaging and analysis.
